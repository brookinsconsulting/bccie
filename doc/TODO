BC CIE TODO
===================

There are still quite a lot of features we could
add to BC CIE.

A few users of BC CIE may require further
extension of the default eZ Publish image alias
image variation image file related features.

If you are interested in sponsoring the development
of any of these features for your eZ Publish web site,
please contact info@brookinsconsulting.com


Features for consideration:

- Add: Remove collection items after export

- Add: Settings: Export Collection ID (Example: csv export already offers this feature without setting, yet sylk export is not consistent)

- Add: Settings: Export Collection Created Date

- Add: Export to 'vcf' format

- Add: Export to 'xml' format

- Add: Settings: Enable / disable warning/notice code which allows for export of less than perfect data (re: allow old code which throws errors to be re-added to the base parser class with settings switch) on above setting)

- Add: Detection of corrupted items and possibly fail when class attributes don't match (per record, per first and last record), possibly depending on above setting)

- Add: Refine translations of extension
