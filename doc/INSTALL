Installing BC CIE extension
==============================================

1. Copy the extension files into the extension directory
   ===========================

   Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ Publish installation.


2. Unpack the extension package files into the extension directory
   ===========================

   Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.

   [tar.gz]
   tar -zxvf bccie-1_0_5.tar.gz

   [zip]
   unzip bccie-1_0_5.tar.zip


3. (Optional) Git clone the latest GitHub brookinsconsulting bccie extension sources into the extension directory
   ===========================

   You can optionaly fetch the latest extension source code from GitHub brookinsconsulting bccie repository into the extension directory

cd /path/to/ezpublish;
cd extension;

mkdir bccie;
cd bccie;

git clone git@github.com:brookinsconsulting/bccie.git . ;

sudo chmod -R 777 ../bccie;


3.1. (Optional) Git download the latest GitHub brookinsconsulting bccie extension sources into the extension directory
     ===========================

     You can optionaly fetch the latest extension source code from GitHub brookinsconsulting bccie repository into the extension directory. Download or clone and place the downloaded extension into your extension folder.

cd /path/to/ezpublish;
cd extension;

mkdir bccie;
cd bccie;

wget https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/bccie/tarball/master;

or

wget https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/bccie/zipball/master

tar -zxf brookinsconsulting-bccie-d1d1411.tar.gz;

or 

unzip brookinsconsulting-bccie-d1d1411.tar.gz;

sudo chmod -R 777 ../bccie;


4. We must now enable the extension in eZ Publish.
   ===========================

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   /path/to/ezpublish/settings/override/. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bccie

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g /path/to/ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site_user/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bccie

   The extension can also be activated through eZ Publish admin interface.
   An additional new menu tab "BC CIE Export" will appear in your Admin-interface.


5. Regenerate eZ Publish class autoloads
   ===========================

   You must regenerate autoloads for extension classes to be available via eZ Publish autoloads. This may mean running the following different commands.

cd /path/to/ezpublish;

php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -v -e;


6. There is no need to configure BC CIE extension after activation
   ===========================

   There are optional settings in settings/bccie.ini mostly workflow event specific. Create a settings override to customize these values.

6.1. Configure optional setttings

     There are optional settings in settings/bccie.ini which you can use to customize your use of the extension.
