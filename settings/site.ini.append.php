# Security Concern: Uncomment the following to enable module views regardless of missing role policy configuration.
# These settings were disabled by default in 2014 due to a confirmed report that they 'could' be used in a bccie
# configuration with eZ Publish which results in anonymous collected information export from user siteaccesses.
# These module view policies should be set instead within the eZ Publish Admin role policy configuration administration.
